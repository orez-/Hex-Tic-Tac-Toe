# Hex-Tic-Tac-Toe
â¬¢ Tic Tac Toe on a hexagonal grid. I wanted to mess with hex grids a bit, and thought the idea might be interesting. It's kind of not.

The goal of the game is to span any row in any of the three directions before your opponent.

#### Known Issues
- Can keep playing after the game ends (gameover logic does not exist clientside, and human moves are not validated against the server).
